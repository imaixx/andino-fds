      Includes:
* A throttle system with keymapping
* A altitude meter
* A heading indicator with 360Â°, Cardinal & Intercardinal directions.
* A adjustable config (Max Speed, minimum/maximum throttle, etc.)


      Future Plans:

* Completely separate UI for helicopters, using collective instead of throttle.
* Using bearings instead of cardinal headings that shift with the heading.
* Replace the altitude bar with a altimeter display.

Please suggest what I should add/change to this script.
